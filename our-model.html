        <p class="description">1. A Map was created in which additional features are added. That included highlighting major roads, marking existing petrol pumps and making population density heat zones.

            The maps were made using QJIS software and its available data was used.
            
            <br>
            2. Now, A code was written which used AI to read and interpret the map and then calculated the optimum locations by increasing value of a point on the road if it is closer high population zones and decreasing it if was nearby other existing pumps.
            
            Code was written in python and its OpenCV library was used to analyze and graph images. Also, MatPlot library to plot image and networkx library to calculate paths were used as well.     
             
            <br>
            3. The final step included making a website which displayed the output of code according to city/state chosen by user.
            
            Website was made on html and designed using CSS.</p>
